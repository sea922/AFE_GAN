Project Title: __Towards Superior Control in Automatic Face Editing with Generative Adversarial Networks__

__Abstract__: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have been widely used in image manipulation tasks such as local editing and image interpolation. This project examines StyleMapGAN, a novel approach that evolves from StyleGAN by replacing AdaIN with intermediate latent space carrying information on spatial dimensions, hence capable of performing high-quality local editing. In addition, by introducing a BiSeNet-based face parsing model, this project develops a fully automated process in local editing of human faces that only takes a few seconds. This project demonstrates that the face parsing model outputs masks that rivals manually labelled face datasets. Furthermore, this project explores more controls in local editing by introducing a pair of unaligned masks during stylemap mixing in W+ space in the generator. Local editing with interpolation is achieved and a demo application is developed to demonstrate the local editing process. Source code is avaliable at https://github.com/mushroomsc/StyleMapGAN.local_editing

## Installation

git clone https://github.com/siidev/AFE_GAN
cd StyleMapGAN_Auto-Recognition/
```

Install the dependencies:
```bash
conda create -y -n stylemapgan python=3.6.12

## Demo

Run demo in your local machine.

All test images are from [CelebA-HQ](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.10196).

```bash
python demo.py
```

<b>Use your own images</b>

```bash
cp -R [source folder] demo/components/img/celeba_hq # copy your own images to the demo folder
cd face_parsing
python test.py # mask generation
```

## Generate images

<b>Local editing</b>
Results are saved to `expr/local_editing`. 

```bash
python generate.py --ckpt expr/checkpoints/celeba_hq_256_8x8.pt --mixing_type local_editing --test_lmdb data/celeba_hq/LMDB_test --local_editing_part [part name]
```
<b>Use your own images</b>
```bash
# transforms raw image to LMDB format
python prepare_data.py [raw images path] --out [destination path] --size [TARGET_SIZE] 
```
